### 1. What is loneliness?

Many of us feel lonely from time to time. These feelings are personal, so each person's experience with loneliness is different.

Some people describe loneliness as the feeling we get when our need for social contact and relationships isn’t met. But loneliness isn’t the same as being alone.

You might feel fine with little social interaction, while others might see this as loneliness.

Some people may only feel lonely at certain times, but others might experience chronic loneliness. This is a deep sense of loneliness that lasts a long time, even when you’re with other people.

It’s a common belief that you have to live alone to feel lonely, or that being lonely means having few friends or family around. 
However, you can have lots of social contact and support and still feel lonely, especially if you don’t feel understood or cared for by those around you.

### 2. Is loneliness a mental health problem? 

Loneliness by itself is not a mental health problem, however having a mental health problem can cause increased feelings of loneliness. For example, if you're struggling with your mental health you may:

- Avoiding social events or parties that you would usually enjoy.
- Having a low self-image or self-esteem.
- Feeling like you are a burden to other people.
- Find it hard to interact with people, or try new things.

Feeling lonely can have a negative impact on your mental health, especially if you've felt lonely for a long time.

Some research suggests that loneliness can increase stress. It's also associated with an increased risk of certain mental health problems. For example, depression, anxiety, low self-esteem and sleep problems.

### 3. What are the causes of loneliness?

Loneliness has many causes, these are different from person to person.

Various life events can make you feel lonely, for example:

- A break up.
- Grief.
- Experiencing mental health problems or disorders such as depression, anxiety or some personality disorders.
- Becoming a parent.
- Moving to a different town.
- Moving to a different school or starting university.

You may also feel loneliness at certain times of the year, for example Christmas, your birthday, Valentines day etc. Studies have found that some people are more prone to loneliness more than others, for example if you:

- Have no friends or family.
- Beloning to a minority group.
- Experience frequent discrimination or stigma.
- Can't maintain a proper social life.
